/*****************************************************************
 * CLOCK SETTING FUNCTION
 * 
 * This file would contain functions for setting the Real-Time
 * Clock (RTC) date and time. Currently not implemented.
 * 
 * FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
 * Could add a menu interface allowing users to set:
 * - Year, month, day
 * - Hour, minute, second
 * - Using the capacitive touch buttons for navigation
 *****************************************************************/

/*****************************************************************
 * SET CLOCK (PLACEHOLDER)
 * 
 * This function is currently empty/unused. In the future, it could
 * provide an interactive menu for setting the RTC time without
 * needing to recompile and upload new code.
 * 
 * The DS3231 RTC chip maintains time even when power is off
 * (via backup battery), but needs to be initially set. Currently,
 * this is done via Serial commands or by manually setting the
 * time in code and uploading once.

void SetClock() {
  // Not implemented
  // Could add menu-based clock setting interface here
}
