### Tips and Tricks:

  

Using **60% high fat diet** in the device can cause the pellets to stick together, preventing the mouse from accessing the food. While the shake setting on the device helps a little bit, occasionally you will have to mix the food up. This can be done by shaking the device or opening the back door and mixing up the food. Also, not overfilling the device and using smaller pieces help to prevent sticking inside the tumbler.

The best open position is when the feeding side of the tumbler is just past the blocking wall.

The best closed position is when the stoper located above the door has just touched the top of the dividing wall.
